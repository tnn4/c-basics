# C Pointers

What's the point of pointers?

Why use them?

What are they? variables that store memory address 

What they do? a whole damn lot

Fun experiment:
- Avoid using pointers completely and see how far you can get in C. Avoid them until you hit a wall.

Pointers, it's that elephant in the memory buffer that is seldom taught well but probably should be.

Ever see some nerd hacking on his computer and seeing crap like this
```
0xFFFFA9840324  IM_A_DUMB_HACK
0x32489f980082  321083021
0x343249809ab3  210320183
0x97496abcdeff  PASSWORD_SECRET
```

The gibberish that begins with `0x` actually means something. They're memory addresses represented in [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal).

What does that gibberish have to do with pointers?

We have to answer some questions to understand why pointers are important.

Why are pointers so important?
- Understanding them is fundamental for any programmer who actually cares about how their programs function
- Pointers can improve performance.
- Pointers allow OOP to be implemented

What would programming be like without pointers?

Error-prone. Imagine trying to find a needle in a haystack 1000 times a day, every day for the rest of your career. If that thought doesn't make you want to shoot yourself in the face, then nothing will.

How are pointers implemented in hardware?

We need to visualize what pointers represent at the machine level.

In modern computers, main memory is divided into bytes. 1 byte = 1 bit, 1 bit = enum(0|1)

```
[0] <-- 1 bit

[0][1][0][1][0][1][0][1] <-- 8 bits = 1 byte
or
[01010101]
```
Each byte has a unique _**address**_ to distinguish it from other bytes in memory.

Define **address**: the specific place where a person, business, or organization can be found and where mail can be received, therefore a memory address is a particular location where some bytes can be found

A computer proram consists of code(machine instructions) and data(variables).

```
Address  Contents
   0     [00110101]
   1     [00000000]
   2     [11110000]
   3     [11100101]
             .
             .
             .
  n-1    [01010100]
```

```
variables occupy one or more **bytes** of memory.

             .
             .
             .
  2000   [        ]  \
  2001   [        ]   ----> i               i (variable) occupies the bytes at address 2000-2002
  2002   [        ]  /                      i's address is 2000
             .
             .
             .
```

What does pointing have to do with addressing?

- _Pointers store addresses_


If we store the address of variable `i` in the pointer variable `p`, we say `p` "points to" `i`

What do pointers have to do with memory?

- _Pointers store memory locations_

What are pointers?
Variables that store memory locations.

A pointer can therefore be thought of as an address.

Addresses are represented by numbers, integers

So what can a pointer be thought as? How can we model pointers?

As arrows (-->)! Arrows point. For an arrow to have some significance, it has to point to something. In programming these pointers usually point to a (location in memory)/ (memory address).

To computers pointers are basically addresses, just a bunch of numbers in memory that point to location in memory that allow you to find some bytes. We come up with the arrow as an abstraction to make the addressing easier to understand.

To monkeys like us, the arrow points. Computers only understand numbers and bits in memory



Model:


```
Computer visual
0 [10101110]

Monkey Visual
You show the content of `p`(the pointer variable) as an arrow directed towards `i`:

p [*]---> [   ]i  
```

What is a pointer again?
A variable that points/leads to something.

If pointers are just memory addresses which are themselves represented as numbers, pointers have to be stored somewhere too right? Yes. They're variables with special and important semantics.

## Pointer syntax

"To point or not to point, that is the question." - Hamlet, probably

c: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3280729/in-c-what-is-the-correct-syntax-for-declaring-pointers

Is it `int* p` or is it `int *p`?
- It depends on who you ask and at what time of day you ask them.
- Jokes aside, it's preference
- For C++ `int* p` is preferred because the typeness is emphasized
- In C `int *p`, b/c "The syntax of the declaration for a variable mimics the syntax of expressions in which the variable might appear."

Pointer variables hold an address.


A type and a pointer to that type are not the same thing even though they almost look the same.
```c
int i = 0; // This is an integer type

int* i_ptr; // This is a pointer to an integer type. It is not an integer
```

Confusing pointers to a type with the type itself is a common mistake and sometimes dangerous mistake.
Stupid but funny analogy
```
typedef struct {
  char species[10];
} Animal;

Animal wolf->species = "wolf" ;
Animal2;

Animal* sheep;

sheep = &wolf; // A wolf in sheep's clothing
Animal2 = *sheep; // that ain't no sheep

```

## Multiple assignments


`int *p1, p2`, one is a pointer, one is not

is not the same as

`int *p1, *p2`

## Pointer Assignment

variable declaration

```
int i, j, *p, *q;
```

Give `p` the _address_ of `i`
```
p = &i; // Give p the _address_ of i


```

```

q = p; // copy the contents of `p` ( the address of `i`) into `q`, 
       // i.e. p and q point to the same place

p[*]
    \
     v
   [ ? ] i 
     ^    
    /  
q[*]
```

## Number of addresses in 32-bit vs 64-bit

Virtually all modern systems are byte addressed.

Each byte has its own address so:
- 32-bit systems have: 2^32 -> 4,294,967,296 bytes or ~ 4Gb
- 64-bit sytsems have: 2^64 -> 1.84e19 bytes

64 bits have 2^32 times the addressing space of 32 bit systems
64-bit systems can theoretically reference 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes, or 17,179,869,184 GB (16 exabytes) of

pointer synonyms
- arrow
- reference
- handle

Proper use of pointers save cpu time and memory.

Improper use of pointers will lead to segfaults and crashes.

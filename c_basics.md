# C Basics

## Header Files

Why does c need header files(`.h`)?

Header files makes your life easier.

https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Header-Files.html

Header files eliminate code redundancy (DRY).
With a header file, the related declarations appear in only one place.

'Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header file into each source file that needs it.'

## Compile

Preprocessing
```c
// Preprocess
// directives (#<directive>) are commands for the preprocessor
// NOTE: there are no semicolons after a directive
```

`include` header
```c
// The #include directive tells the preprocessor to open a specified file and
// copy the header file into each source file that needs it
```


// The `include` directive has two forms:

```c
#include <filename> // for C's own std library
// For example, the compiler will look inside `usr/include`

#include "path/to/filename" // for our own headers
// The compiler looks in the current directory
// Then the default system header locations

```

```
The places that will be searched for can be altered with `-I path`.
It is best not to put absolute paths in the #include directives
For max portability use relative paths
``````

```c
// stdio.h is a header file
// it defines variable types, macros, and functions for input/output
#include <stdio.h>
```


Compile: This program will become machine instructions (object code)
Object files have .o extension in UNIX in .obj in Windows

Link: The object code will be linked together into a executable

`gcc` is one of the most popular C compilers and is supplied with Linux

Fun fact: For a cross-platform solution, you can use the [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) compiler as a drop in replacement:

`zig cc -o my_code my_code.c`

# Language Features

## Comments

Use them

```c
// This is a single line comment

/*
    This is a multi-line comment
*/
```

## Functions

Unlike languages like Javascript, Java, C#, where functions can be declared anywhere in the source (JS has hoisting and Java, C# don't require header files) function order does matter in C. C needs to functions to be declared at the top or in header files (`.h`) before they can be used.

```c
// # Function Prototypes
// This is a prototype
// You need to declare a function prototype in the header
void read_an_int();

void initialization_example() {
    // We can give a variable an intial value when it is declared
    // The value 8 is said to be an initializer
    int init1=8;
}

// Run: gcc a.c -o a
// Run: ./a
int main(void) {
    printf("Hello world! I C you.\n");
    read_an_int();
    return 0;
}


// WARN: If the function prototype was not declared on top, this function will cause an implicit declaration error
void read_an_int() {
    // declare i
    int i; 
    
    // the d is called a format specifier
    // C: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_data_types
    scanf("%d", &i); // read an integer store into i
    printf("You entered: %d\n", i);
}
```

## type aliasing
- redefine name of already existing data type
- i.e. type alias
- `typdef unsigned char byte_t`

## arrow operator
`foo->bar` is equivalent to `(*foo).bar`, i.e. it gets the *member* called `bar` from the *struct* that `foo` points to.

__indirection with pointers example__

```c
#include <stdio.h>  
int main()  {  
    // Create an int binding/container and attach/store it with value 1
    int x=1;
    
    // Create ptr to int, pointers have types too
    int *ptr;
    
    // Store the address of x into ptr, NOTE: we're storing the address which is distinct from the value
    // think of this as creating a link to endpoint x with the entry `ptr`
    ptr=&x;
    
    // Dereference the address to get to the value value, i.e *(address) -> value
    *ptr=8;
    printf("value of x is : %d", x);  
    return 0;
}
```
